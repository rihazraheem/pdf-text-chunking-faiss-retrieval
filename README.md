# pdf-text-chunking-faiss-retrieval
Efficiently chunk, embed, and retrieve text from PDF documents using FAISS for fast semantic search. This project extracts text from PDFs, breaks it into manageable chunks, embeds those chunks with SentenceTransformer, and indexes them in FAISS for quick similarity-based retrieval.
